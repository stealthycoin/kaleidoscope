\section{Abstract}
We give a definition of \textit{Functional Reactive Programming} (FRP) for use in a javascript based environment that allows for the manipulation of DOM elements and remote servers through the use of sinks and sources in the network. There is also an implementation of the FRP network using a DSL to specify the varying layers of the network, this allows a programmer to easily design networks to accomplish tasks by simply specifying the layers and how the layers interact. Our implementation builds on previous ones by being more practical, the DSL arises naturally from our definition of FRP and the DSL is simple to use and requires no knowledge of the underlying FRP concepts. (END BULLSHIT SALES PITCH)
